    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  When handling hyperspectral imagery we have to cope with a lot of data.
  Its not a good idea to send all this information 'as it is', but we would
  want to compress it before sending it through a channel.
<p>
  Another kind of problem emerges when looking for spectral images through the
  Internet. This problem could be seen like a 'sea of data', adding to this
  the fact of the size of each unit of data in this sea.
<p>
  <b>HyperProcessing</b> is an application to overcome those problems.
  With simple wavelet transformations and applying vector quantization we want
  to obtain high compression ratios. Those operations are added to the ones already
  avaliable in JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) API, so we can process images to
  enhance them or analyze them. We also set bases here of Internet cooperation
  on images.
